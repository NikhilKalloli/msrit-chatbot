#### DEPARTMENT HISTORY

 The Department of Mechanical Engineering commenced in the year 1962 with an intake of 60 students. The department has grown strong over the last 54 years with the intake rising to 180 students educated by a teaching staff comprising 50 members. The department was affiliated to the Bangalore University for a period of 35 years starting from the year 1962 and then the affiliation changed to the Visvesvaraya Technological University (VTU) in the year 1997\. The department was awarded the autonomous status by the VTU in the year 2007\. A Master’s degree course in Manufacturing Science and Engineering was introduced in the year 1985 to create adequate opportunities to scholars with a desire to pursue career in research and education. Acknowledging the requirements of automation in Production Industries, the department introduced one more Master’s degree course with the title Computer Integrated Manufacturing in the year 2004\. The Department also offers research programme which includes MSc Engineering by research and PhD degree from VTU and at present 24 researchers are pursuing PhD.
