#### DEPARTMENT HISTORY

 The department was started in the year 1962 with Under Graduate Program of sanctioned intake 60, along with the establishment of the college. In the year 2003, the department was recognized as a research centre by Visvesvaraya Technological University, Belgaum to offer PhD and M Sc (Engg. by Research) programs. The department has been accredited by NBA, New Delhi since 2001.

  
The department has additional facilities to enhance the quality of teaching-learning process and skill development by establishing the laboratories- Process Automation and Control lab, and Schneider Centre for building automation in collaboration with Schneider Electric, Bangalore. The department is also having NI LabVIEW Academy in collaboration with National Instruments, India and National MEMS Design Centre, supported by NPMASS, India supporting curricular and co-curricular activities.

  
The department has 12 well-qualified faculty members. The entire faculty holds postgraduate degree specialized in diversified areas of Electrical Engineering like Power Systems, Power Electronics, Control Systems, Electrical Machines, etc. 11 of the faculty members are doctorates from various esteemed institutions like IISc, Bengaluru; NITK, Surathkal; Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore; Visvesvaraya Technological University, Belagavi; Pondicherry University, Pondicherry; and Jain University, Bengaluru. In addition, the department is actively involved in research, testing and consultancy in the area of High Voltage applications under the able guidance of Dr. G. R. Nagabhushana, Formerly Chairman, Department of High Voltage Engineering, Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, and is presently with the department as Professor Emeritus. The main focus of the department is to impart quality technical education to students in UG, PG and Ph.D levels based on OBE. Many technical activities are in place to enhance both technical and communication skills for students and staff.
