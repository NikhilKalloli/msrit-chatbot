## Department of Chemistry

## DEPARTMENT PROFILE

#### Department History

 The Department of Chemistry was established in the year 1962 to preparing the students for careers in all the fields of engineering aspects and also carry out basic and applied research work. The department consists of nine well qualified and experienced faculty members; eight of them are Doctorate holders. The Department also has five non-teaching staff. The main activity of the department is to teach engineering chemistry theory and Laboratory courses to the under graduate engineering students of all disciplines. Department is also involved in teaching technical chemistry and Instrumental methods of analysis for III and IV semester BE chemical engineering students, along with respective laboratories. The Department is a recognized research center by VTU. All faculty members are actively engaged in research work and eighteen research scholars have registered for Ph.D. The department is constantly organizing conferences/ seminars and FDP programs. The department conducts annually International ‘Australian national chemistry quiz’ by The Royal Australian Chemical Institute, Australia.

  
#### Vision

 Department strives for Development of curriculum viewing emerging trends in technology with a balanced approach towards Institute Industry interaction and academic excellence along with research in Basic Sciences.

  
#### Mission

 Providing outstanding teaching and quality training in chemistry to all students at all levels and in all disciplines and also develop and maintain research programs of National and International relevance and serve the society through unique expertise and talent found in the department.

  
* [Offered Programs](#tab1-1)
