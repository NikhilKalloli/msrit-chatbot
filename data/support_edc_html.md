| **CreatHives**                        | Mr. Manoj Kumar Kalaivanan Mr. Vignesh Subramanyam Mr. Jayanth Veerandra Ms. Ranjini Prabhu Mr.Vishnu Tenkayala | CreatHives, an incubated company at Entrepreneurship Development Cell has been able to connect to various investors and grant agencies. It all began in 2011, when a bunch of theatre enthusiasts from Ramaiah college were asked to put up a performance for the Bangalore Mirror Amateur Theatre Festival. When they showcased their act, 86, based on the Sri Lankan civil war, they left their judge in tears. It was on that day, TEA Arts, a creative arts society was formed. From enacting scripts that were close to their heart to mentoring nearly 150 artists who have gone on to break ground in the arenas of performing and digital arts gave them immense motivation. TEA Arts pioneered The Bangalore Theatre League the same year and has gone on to host two consecutive leagues thereafter. Simultaneously, TEA Arts, has been chosen to host performance campaigns for The Times of India, Bangalore Mirror, Fortis Hospitals, The Wedding Filmer, Dream-ADream and CRY among a spectrum of other media, profit, and not for profit. With this expansive and interesting experience in their portfolio, they now endeavour to scale the activities of TEA Arts both to reach a wider audience pan India as well as include a wider range of existing and upcoming creative arts into its scale. Their vision is detailed, scalable and born out of hands on experience in the field. At this juncture, there is the inevitable hurdle of bringing focus within the arts segment given the imbalance between the market requirement and what the artists have to oﬀer.It's a great new web application that enables networking between artists and vendors in need of artists such as NGOs, Corporate sectors, other commercial set-ups, etc. CreatHives is an initiative that brings to focus, the imbalance between the market requirement and what the artists have to offer. We, at CreatHives, cater to both ends of a creative collaboration, finding the right artist for creative needs and the artist finding the right kind of work. Now you can meet other artists, trainers, vendors, and network all you want with just a few clicks. |
