The graduate engineering program is governed by a robust and dynamic Quality Management system that covers all academic and co-curricular activities including course revision, delivery, evaluation, laboratory assignments, and seminars. The department has state of the art laboratory, equipment resources, and committed faculty having the best of the academic and industry recognition. The Institute is autonomous from 2007\. The U.G program is accredited by NBA in the year 2004, 2010, 2016, and 2019 and valid for 3 years till 2022\. The P.G program is accredited by NBA in the year 2019 and valid for 3 years till 2022\. The department has a Research Centre recognized by VTU, Belgaum, offering M.Sc (Engg.) by research and Ph.D. programs since 2012.

The department has 15 faculty members, 10 faculties are Ph.D. holders and the others are pursuing Ph.D. The faculty members have competence in Core areas of Digital Signal Processing, Image Processing, Control Systems, Mobile Adhoc Networks, Wireless Sensor Networks, Internet of Things, Embedded Systems, Wireless Networking, DSP Processors, RF Communication, Neural Networks, Fuzzy Logic, VLSI Design, Microstrip Antenna Design, Meta Material Structure analysis and MIMO Array antenna. 

The department has collaboration with some of the leading industries (Ansys, JV Micronics, Rohde and Schwarz, Nokia, Intel, Samsung, Techni Lab Instruments, NAL, LRDE) and with leading national and international universities like Bradley university, IIT-M, Stanford University enabling the department to focus on R & D, thus providing new avenues for PG/UG students for placement and higher studies. The department has introduced new pedagogical initiatives in teaching-learning, one highlight is the inclusion of MOOC courses in the selected courses of curriculum. New labs have been introduced into the curriculum with support from the industry; such as the Microwave & Antenna Lab with support from ANSYS and Digital Circuit design with support from Agimus Technologies. The department has established a Centre of Excellence – “Centre for Antennas and Radio Frequency Systems” (CARFS). This is a world class research lab equipped with a state of the art Anechoic Chamber and related instrumentation.

There has been a significant increase in student involvement in industry sponsored projects by companies such as SAMSUNG, Elena Geosystems and Stellantis. Four professional chapters have been opened to carry out technical activities for improving the technical skill set of students and faculty. Students are also strongly involved in activities of Technical Societies, such as IEEE and IETE. Apart from this, students are encouraged to participate in co-curricular and extra-curricular activities at the state, national and international level and our students have won many prestigious awards. A sizeable number of students have pursued their higher education at various premier institutes in India and abroad after having qualified GATE, GRE & TOEFL exams. The students undergo internships at various premier institutes in India and abroad.

The faculty have quality publications in SCI and SCOPUS indexed journals, book chapters and conferences. The department faculty have good number of patents. The department faculty research is funded by national and state funding agencies like DST, BIRAC, AICTE, VGST and industries like Stellantis, SAMSUNG, Elena Geosystems, ABB and many more.
