## Evolution

Timeline from 1962 to till now.

* ####  The Beginning  
 Started in 1962  
![](http://d2e9h3gjmozu47.cloudfront.net/Gallery/about-us/pooja.png) M S Ramaiah Institute of Technology (MSRIT) was started in 1962 by Late Dr. M S Ramaiah, our Founder Chairman who was a renowned visionary, philanthropist, and a pioneer in creating several landmark infrastructure projects in India. Noticing the shortage of talented engineering professionals required to build a modern India, Dr. M S Ramaiah envisioned MSRIT as an institute of excellence imparting quality and affordable education. Part of Gokula Education Foundation, MSRIT has grown over the years with significant contributions from various professionals in different capacities, ably led by Dr. M S Ramaiah himself, whose personal commitment has seen the institution through its formative years. Today, MSRIT stands tall as one of India’s finest names in Engineering Education and has produced around 35,000 engineering professionals who occupy responsible positions across the globe.
* ####  Early Period (1962 – 1972)  
 From 1962 – 1972

After assessment, in February 2001, NBA accorded accreditation to all the major departments of the Institute for their UG programs. Since then the Institute has been consistently participating in the accreditation process.  
   * MSRIT participated in and successfully completed Phase I of TEQIP, Technical Education Quality Improvement program, an initiative of the Government of India with funding from World Bank. MSRIT has been selected to participate in Phase II of TEQIP also under sub – component 1.2 with focus on PG Education and Research.
