## School of Architecture

## DEPARTMENT PROFILE

#### VISION

 To achieve and propagate high standards of excellence in architectural education.

  
#### MISSION

* The school’s commitment is to prepare people to make a difference.
* To create an environment that shall foster the growth of intellectually capable, innovative and entrepreneurial professionals, who shall contribute to the growth of the society by adopting core values of learning exploration, rationality and enterprise.
* To contribute effectively by developing a sustainable technical education system to meet the changing technological needs incorporating relevant social concerns and to build an environment to create and propagate innovative designs and technologies.

  
#### DEPARTMENT PROFILE

* The School of Architecture is now autonomous (affiliated to VTU) providing scope for further improvement. The focus has been towards fostering novel concepts and solutions in architectural design. The student’s response is very encouraging and the school recognises and appreciates such good students by awarding them. Many of the students after graduation have pursued higher studies in various universities in the country and abroad. There is a good demand for the school graduates in the industry and is developing initiatives towards co-branding of the industry and the institution school. Many have started their own enterprise and architectural practice as well.
* All this has been possible as a result of the efforts of the impeccable faculty of the school. The faculty is committed to the welfare and success of the students. The teachers of the school are also engaged in enhancing their knowledge and skills and many are engaged in research activities as well. The school has experts in specialized disciplines like Planning, Landscape Architecture and Interior Design. Faculties of the school also actively participate in National and International conferences and publish and present papers.
* The school as part of consultancy started off with the maiden project to redevelop the MSRIT engineering college campus and is now involved in various campus designs.
* The school is proud to have started the M.Arch programme in Landscape Architecture. This was started in the year 2011\. The Master of Landscape Architecture is a 2 year full time postgraduate programme. The prescribed course is two years of full-time study.
* The course consists of areas of study ranging from community-scale landscape planning to the details of landscape construction technology, with an emphasis on sustainable practices in landscape architecture. The course covers a broad spectrum of topics from local to regional scale. Balancing theory with hands-on practice, design aspects of landscape architecture is given equal prominence to direct the students towards a holistic approach to Sustainable Landscape Architecture. The course is structured to analyze and respond to critical issues facing contemporary landscape architectural design and development. Thus the students have the opportunity to explore alternative, innovative, and experimental design.
* The course will enable design and construction professionals to enhance their understanding of the integral relationship between natural processes and human activity, and how sustainable design fits into everyday life, explore design options to address the same and examine policies, regulations, and standards in industry and government for implementation of the principles of sustainable design.

  
#### DEPARTMENT HISTORY
