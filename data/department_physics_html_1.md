## Department of Physics

## DEPARTMENT PROFILE

#### VISION

 To develop undergraduate courses of best academic standards comparable to universities of international repute and be a catalytic agent to help students to manifest their latent potential.

  
#### MISSION

 To Provide the best training through teaching and research to enable the students to master the concepts in physics and apply successfully to real time problems and to kindle their interest in cutting edge research areas.

  
#### DEPARTMENT PROFILE

 The department of Physics has a team of dynamic and well-qualified faculty (all with Ph.D) with a passion for research. It is recognized as a Research & Development (R & D) canter by VTU in April 2008\. Eight research scholars have been awarded Ph.D. from the department. At present, one full time and 9 part time research scholars have registered for Ph.D. Five external funded research projects have been successfully completed and two projects are ongoing with external funding of more than Rs. 80 lakhs from BRNS and VGST. The Department has very good infrastructure, well-equipped spacious laboratories, good computational and research facilities. The research lab is equipped with Spectrofluorometer, Polarizing Microscope with hot stage, Digital microbalance, thin film spin coating unit, Sonicator, muffle furnace, vacuum oven and hot air oven. Gaussian 09, Crystal17 and other softwares are available in the department for computational analysis. At present, active research in the department is in the fields of Materials Science, Fluorescence spectroscopy, Crystallography, Liquid crystals, Luminescence of Nanomaterials, computational studies, Atomic and molecular collisions.

  
#### DEPARTMENT HISTORY

 The Physics department is one of the oldest departments of the M.S. Ramaiah Institute of Technology (MSRIT) established in 1962\. The Physics department has been recognized as VTU research centre in April 2008\. Engineering Physics emphasizes the basic principles underlying most engineering developments, vital to engineers of all branches. The department has been working towards fulfilling its mission through a synergistic combination of teaching and research. The department has been conducting sky watch programs, science quiz and guest lectures by eminent academicians to kindle the interest of the students.

  
* [Offered Programs](#tab1-1)
