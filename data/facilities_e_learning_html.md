## E-Learning Centre

The cutting-edge "E-Learning Centre" at Ramaiah Institute of Technology, a world-class facility revolutionizing the way education is delivered. With a focus on providing exceptional online learning experiences, our state-of-the-art centre offers advanced features for recording and live streaming of classes, ensuring seamless knowledge transfer to students worldwide. We have 2 captivating studios dedicated to capturing and live-streaming lectures. Studio 1 is a dynamic setup, featuring an interactive panel and a vibrant chroma screen, alongside 2 PTZ cameras that capture linear and vibrant angles. Studio 2, equipped with an interactive panel and a high-quality PTZ camera, provides an equally engaging learning environment. Both studios offer individual video monitors, allowing resource person to maintain a visual connection while delivering their lectures. Studio 1 takes it a step further with a sophisticated podium, complete with a digital tablet and stylus, empowering presenters to annotate presentations effortlessly on the captivating chroma screen. This facility is air-conditioned, ensuring a conducive learning atmosphere for the resource person and the staff working here. To prioritize security, access to the E-Learning Centre is restricted to authorized personnel, safeguarded by a state-of-the-art authorised biometric login system.

The Control Room (CR), is the nerve center of our E-Learning Centre. Here, our highly skilled technical team orchestrates the seamless operation of our studios, ensuring an exceptional learning experience for all. Within the CR, our dedicated professionals meticulously craft each frame, leveraging a series of preview monitors to precisely set the ideal composition for the resource person. This meticulous attention to detail guarantees that every lecture is visually captivating and engaging. Once the frame is perfected, the output from the vision mixing desk takes center stage on the "Transmission" monitor. This critical step prepares the final studio output, ensuring the highest quality for our online learners. Communication is key in our CR, and we provide desk "talkback microphones" and loudspeakers to facilitate seamless instruction and guidance exchange between the studio and CR staff. This streamlined communication flow ensures that every aspect of the production runs smoothly, resulting in exceptional online classes. To further enhance the experience, our E-Learning Centre features a dedicated Green Room. This space serves as a comfortable and private area where instructors can prepare themselves before entering the studio. It offers a calm environment, allowing presenters to relax and focus, ensuring their best performance. Discover the power of our Control Room at Ramaiah Institute of Technology's E-Learning Centre, where technical expertise and cutting-edge equipment come together to create a truly immersive and impactful online learning experience.

Experience the future of education at Ramaiah Institute of Technology's E-Learning Centre, where innovation meets excellence and where we transformative journey as we shape the future of online education by redefining the boundaries of learning possibilities.
