####  Pradarshana – Project Abstracts

 Open day exhibition is organized to exhibit application based projects undertaken by our students. This event helps in enhancing the practical knowledge and showcases the innovative ideas among the students from various disciplines, and to motivate them for future competition in their respective areas and to address the real time problems. PRADARSHANA every year aims at providing an opportunity for MSRIT students to engage and excel in confronting real world design problems. They provide a means for students to apply the various skills acquired from engineering courses throughout their undergraduate study period, including project management, multi-disciplinary teamwork, design skills, and fabrication techniques. By virtue of the submitted reports, students can demonstrate their creative skills in identifying real world problems, formulating alternative solutions, and systematically arriving at final designs that satisfy various professional standards and realistic design constraints.
