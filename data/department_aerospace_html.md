#### MISSION

* To create conducive learning environment with state of the art facilities to impart quality education in aerospace engineering
* To promote industry collaborated activities to develop aerospace domain clusters for skill development suitable for aerospace research and employment
* 3.To develop and promote student centric centers of aerospace engineering for providing national/international exposure through projects and related activities.

  
#### ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT

The Department of Aerospace Engineering was established in 2024 and offers a four-year B.E. Aerospace Engineering Program with an intake of 60 students and a two-year M.Tech. Aerospace Engineering Program with an intake of 18 students. The emphasis of the department is on imparting quality education in Aerospace Engineering, enabling the creation of expertise in this specialized area to cater to the requirements of the fast-growing aerospace sector in the country. In addition, the Department actively promotes research initiatives in the various sub-domains of the discipline. At present, the department has five full-time faculty members with all of them possessing Ph.D. degrees with specializations across various streams within aerospace engineering. All faculty members have extensive teaching and research experience and have consistently published and presented their work in reputed peer-reviewed international journals and conferences. In addition, they possess proven expertise in executing externally funded research projects. The faculties have been recognized as Research Supervisors by Visvesvaraya Technological University to supervise Scholars pursuing Ph.D./M.S.(Research)/ Integrated Ph.D. programs The department has established well-equipped academic laboratories in areas of aerodynamics, structures, propulsion and flight simulation. Key facilities include a well- instrumented computerized subsonic wind tunnel, a micro gas turbine engine test rig, and a high-fidelity flight simulator with advanced features. The department also supports design and analysis activities via CAD modelling and simulation facilities. These resources significantly support both faculty and students in conducting in-house research and development activities. The department has been promoting extracurricular activities, allowing students to establish clubs like the Aeromodelling Club, CubeSat Club, alongside many other initiatives which are currently in the pipeline. In addition to academics, the students are encouraged to participate in various competitions allowing them gain recognition and receive prizes.
