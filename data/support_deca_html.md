## Department of Extra-Curricular Activities

At RIT we strongly believe in the holistic development of students, i.e, they develop in such a way that they evolve into full-fledged and confident professionals by the time they graduate. This is made possible by encouraging them to engage in various cultural activities such as music, theatre, literary, visual & fine arts, etc. apart from Sports, NSS, Entrepreneurship Cell and other similar pursuits.

Cultural Activities is not just about entertainment; they help molding the personality of the students and help them in the following ways:

> * Enhances soft skills such as communication skills, etiquette and confidence levels.
> * Helps students in the areas of time management, emotion management, success (& failure) management, crisis management and more importantly people management.
> * While good grades equip students to get their first jobs, extra-curricular activities help students to equip for their whole lives.
> * They help inculcating in students values such as empathy, broad mindedness, team-spirit, self-control, ethics, acceptance of pluralities in society, corporate social responsibility, and so on.

Acknowledging the importance of Cultural Activities in the overall development of the Students, this Institution has created a separate department, known as the Department of Extra-Curricular Activities (DECA), to oversee all such activities of students on campus and off-campus throughout the year.

5. **UDBHAV – The Intercollegiate Cultural Extravaganza**  
Udbhav is the annual cultural extravaganza of MSRIT. Its size and magnitude, has earned it a spot among the ten best college fests in Karnataka, according to a survey by Deccan Herald. With a footfall of approximately 15,000 people and participants from over 35 colleges across Karnataka, Udbhav is a melting pot of culture. It draws talented youth from across the state to display their colossal talents. Spanning over 3 days, this fest provides a platform to its own students as well as to various young aspirants across the state. The events are categorized into intercollegiate and intra-college to create an atmosphere of maximum exposure to the students. Each year, we host 27 intra-colleges and 30 intercollegiate events, which enable students to showcase their talents in the fields of art, music, literature, dance and theatre, amongst many others. This fest has created a niche for itself in the hearts of the students, and we hope that it continues to do so along with the ever enduring support from the college management.
